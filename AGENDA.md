# Docker workshop agenda

Please see [the README for this repository](README.md) for time and location
information.

-----

This hands-on workshop will introduce attendees to the basics of
Docker, a containerization technology that can be used for running,
wrapping, distributing, and publishing scientific software and
workflows.  Docker containers provide a lightweight computational
framework for all of these things, and we intend that this workshop
will provide a friendly and welcoming environment for trying it out.

People new to docker are welcome to attend! We do suggest that
attendees have some familiarity with the UNIX command line.
