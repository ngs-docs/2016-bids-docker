# Docker workshop agenda

BIDS, UC Berkeley, January 7-8th; 9:15am-4:30pm.

This hands-on workshop will introduce attendees to the basics of
Docker, a containerization technology that can be used for running,
wrapping, distributing, and publishing scientific software and
workflows.  Docker containers provide a lightweight computational
framework for all of these things, and we intend that this workshop
will provide a friendly and welcoming environment for trying it out.

People new to docker are welcome to attend! We do suggest that
attendees have some familiarity with the UNIX command line.

## Schedule

Thursday morning:

* Hands-on introduction to Docker: what it does, how it works, running & working with docker.

Thursday afternoon:

* docker-machine and docker running on Amazon, Digital Ocean, etc;
* Dockerfiles and building docker images;
* working with the Docker hub;

* Containerization and scientific workflows: bioboxes etc.

Friday morning:

* working with docker for research and teaching
* Jupyter in docker
* R in docker
* challenge exercises

Friday afternoon:

* docker-compose
* mybinder and other cool things
