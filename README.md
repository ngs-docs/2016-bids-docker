# Docker Hands-on materials

Jan 7-8, 2016

Thursday, 9:15am-4:30pm

Friday, 9:15am-3pm

Instructors: [C. Titus Brown](titus@idyll.org), Luiz Irber, and maybe
Carl Boettiger.

## Overview

This hands-on workshop will introduce attendees to the basics of
Docker, a containerization technology that can be used for running,
wrapping, distributing, and publishing scientific software and
workflows. Docker containers provide a lightweight computational
framework for all of these things, and we intend that this workshop
will provide a friendly and welcoming environment for trying it out.

People new to Docker are welcome to attend! We do suggest that
attendees have some familiarity with the UNIX command line.

See [the BIDS workshop
page](http://bids.berkeley.edu/events/bids-docker-workshop) for venue
information.

### Software Installation etc.

If you have a relatively recent laptop, please install the latest
version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) by clicking "Get Started
with Docker" on [www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/) and following
the instructions to install Docker.  If you get to the end of the
first step (`docker run hello-world` that is all you need!)

As a backup for installation problems, we will be using Amazon Web
Services; please sign up for an account at http://aws.amazon.com/.
After creating an account, you should sign in to the Console and click
on the "EC2" compute service (upper left); it may ask you to activate
your account via a phone number.  Note that an Amazon Web Services
account will also be useful for people interested in exploring
docker-machine!
